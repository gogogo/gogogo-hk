-----------
Indentation
-----------

Indentation should be 4 spaces per level. DO NOT USE TABS.

For Vim users, this may be useful in your .vimrc (to highlight all tabs in the indentation):

au BufRead,BufNewFile *.py highlight PythonTabIndents ctermbg=red guibg=red
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.py match PythonTabIndents /^\s*    /

(Some existing code have tabs as indentation. Convert them back to spaces as
necessary during the course of development, but otherwise leave them intact)

----------
Debugging
----------

Print debug message:

Add the following lines to setting_private.py

"""
import logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level = logging.DEBUG,
    format = '%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s',
)
"""

In your code:

import logging
logging.debugging("Message")
